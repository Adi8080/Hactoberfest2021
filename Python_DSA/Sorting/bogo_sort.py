Bogo Sort

(also known as permutation sort, stupid sort, or slowsort) is a highly inefficient sorting algorithm based on the generate and test paradigm. 
The function successively generates permutations of its input until it finds one that is sorted. 
It is not useful for sorting, but may be used for educational purposes, to contrast it with more efficient algorithms.

        Best Case Complexity: O(n)
        Worst Case Complexity: O(âˆž)
        Average Case Complexity: O(n(n-1)!)
